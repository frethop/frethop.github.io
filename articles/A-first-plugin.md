# A First Plugin
In this article, we will get started with a simple plugin for Obsidian.  We will walk through how  to start, what tools we need to do development work, and how to do a little experimentation.

Much has been written and recorded about first plugins.  In fact, in the "Obsidian Plugin Developer Docs" there is a nice set of instructions, written by Marcus Olsson, on how to get started.  There are many videos that you can watch to get started, including "Create Your Own Obsidian Plugin" by Antone Heyward and 

We will try to add to the wealth of information you can access.  

## Frustration gets you started
To write a good plugin, you need to be able to use the plugin.  Plugins -- and phone apps, and other pieces of software -- come from your experience, and a lot of times from your frustration.

Before you start writing your Obsidian plugin, you need a few things.

- **Computer and storage:** It's pretty obvious that you need a computer to create a plugin.  You also need storage, but not a lot.  Complex plugins with a lot of code take up around 250 MB of storage; smaller, less complex plugins take up under 80 MB.  Installed plugins take up a lot less.
