# A First Plugin
In this article, we will get started with a simple plugin for Obsidian.  We will walk through how  to start, what tools we need to do development work, and how to do a little experimentation.

Much has been written and recorded about first plugins.  In fact, in the "Obsidian Plugin Developer Docs" there is a nice set of instructions, written by Marcus Olsson, on how to get started.  There are many videos that you can watch to get started, including "Create Your Own Obsidian Plugin" by Antone Heyward and 

We will try to add to the wealth of information you can access.  

## Frustration gets you started
To write a good plugin, you need to be able to use the plugin.  Plugins -- and phone apps, and other pieces of software -- come from your experience, and a lot of times from your frustration.  It's really hard to come up with an idea out of thin air; you typically need to have some personal investment in the software you are writing.  (This is likely not true if you are writing software for a development company.)

For example, it might be hard to write a plugin that implements a day planner if you don't really use one.  However, it would be easier to develop a plugin that autocorrects when you type two capital letters in a row (like I do all the time).
